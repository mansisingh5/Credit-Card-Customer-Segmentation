# Clustering for Effective Marketing Strategy  

## Overview  
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using **clustering techniques** to enhance marketing strategies. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on behavioral and financial attributes, enabling businesses to design **personalized marketing campaigns**.  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains **customer transaction data**, including:  
- **Spending patterns**  
- **Purchase frequency**  
- **Transaction value**  
- **Engagement metrics**  

## Key Techniques Used  
### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Handling **missing values**  
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler**  
- Applying **PCA** for dimensionality reduction  

### **2. Clustering Models**  
- **K-Means Clustering** (Elbow method for optimal K)  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** (Dendrogram analysis)  
- **DBSCAN** for density-based segmentation  

### **3. Customer Segmentation Analysis**  
- Visualizing customer clusters using **scatter plots & heatmaps**  
- Identifying key **customer personas** based on cluster attributes  

## Results & Insights  
- Customers were **grouped into X clusters** based on spending and behavior.  
- Key findings: **(e.g., high-spenders, discount-seekers, frequent buyers, etc.)**  
- Marketing strategies were proposed for each segment to improve engagement.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis  
- **Elbow method & Silhouette Score** for cluster validation  

## How to Run the Notebook  
1. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
